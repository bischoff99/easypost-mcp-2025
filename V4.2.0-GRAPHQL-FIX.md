# GraphQL Route Ordering Fix

## Issue
GraphQL endpoint mounted but SPA fallback catches requests.

## Context7 Solution
Mount GraphQL between API routes and SPA fallback:

1. Health & Status endpoints
2. Static files
3. API routes (/api/*)
4. **GraphQL (/graphql)** ‚Üê Add here
5. Error handler
6. SPA fallback (catch-all)

## Apply to src/server.js
After line with API routes (after batchRoutes), before error handler:

```javascript
// GraphQL will be mounted here in startServer()
